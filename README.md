Usage Information
-----------------

This project uses the AWS SDK for Java to create helpful Ant tasks for developers to incorporate into their builds. 
You can use these tasks to make your build process simpler and to automate the process of deployment.
To use the tasks, all you need to do is call taskdef, targeting "taskdefs.xml" in the jar.
```
<taskdef resource="taskdefs.xml" classpath="path/to/aws-java-sdk-ant-tasks-${version}.jar" />
```
The tasks will then be ready for you to call throughout the rest of the buildfile. For some usage examples, check out the integration-tests.xml. Read ahead for some more in-depth documentation.
Note that all tasks have two optional fields: `awsAccessKeyId` and `awsSecretKey`. You can use these to specify your AWS credentials, or you can leave them blank. If you leave them blank, the tasks will defer to the default credential chain, which looks for your credentials in the following places, in this order:
    Environment Variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY
    Java System Properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey
    Credential profiles file at the default location (~/.aws/credentials) shared by all AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI
    Instance profile credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service 
If no valid credentials are found after looking in all 5 places, the task will default to anonymous access, which is likely to lead to errors.

S3 task usage guide
===================

Create bucket task
------------------

Defined in taskdefs.xml as `create-bucket`
The only required parameter here is the name of the bucket. Make sure it follows the rules of a bucket name and isn't taken, or an exception will be thrown.
```
<create-s3-bucket bucketName="mybucketname" />
```

Upload to bucket task
---------------------
Defined in taskdefs.xml as `upload-to-s3`
Upload to bucket

This uses Ant's fileset strategy. This makes it easy to specify either a single file or a fileset, which can use pattern sets. If you specify the keyPrefix parameter, then all files in the fileset will have that prefixed to their key in S3. Read up on Ant's filesets here.

Available attributes:

| Attribute      | Description                                                                                          | Required?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| bucketName     | The name of your bucket in S3                                                                        | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| keyPrefix      | A prefix to append to the beginning of all keys.                                                     | No. If specified, the keys of the files you upload will be of the format: keyPrefix+fileName                                                                                                                         |
| continueOnFail | Whether to continue uploading files if one file in the fileset fails to upload. Defaults to "false". | No. Defaults to "false". If set to "true", the task will continue to upload the rest of the files in the set, even if one fails to upload. If left "false", an exception will be thrown if one file fails to upload. |
| printStatusUpdates | Display progress during uploading                                                                | No. If not specified, no progress will be displayed |

Nested elements:

Nested [filesets](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html). At least one is required. Every file included in the fileset will be uploaded to S3.

Some examples:  

Uploading one file:
```
<upload-to-s3 bucketName="mybucketname">
     <fileset file="myfile.txt" />
</upload-to-s3>
```

Uploading a set of files:
```
<upload-to-s3 bucketName="mybucketname" keyPrefix="myprefix/">
     <fileset includes="*.txt"/>
</upload-to-s3>
```

Uploading a set of files, continuing if one happens to fail:
```
<upload-to-s3 bucketName="mybucketname" keyPrefix="myprefix/" continueOnFail="true"/>
     <fileset dir = "~/mydir">
</upload-to-s3>
```

Download from bucket task
-------------------------

Two major options for use here: To download a single file, specify a key, and if you want, a target file. If the target file is specified, the object from S3 will be downloaded to that file. If not specified, the name of the file will be equal to the key.

To download multiple files, specify a prefix and a target directory. All files that begin with the prefix will download to the target directory. Their names will be equal to their key names.

Available attributes: 

| Attribute      | Description                                                                                                           | Required?                                                                           |

| awsSecretKey   | Your AWS Secret Key credential                                                                                        | No. If not specified, the task will defer to the default credential chain.          |
| bucketName     | The name of your bucket in S3                                                                                         | Yes.                                                                                |
| key            | If downloading one single S3 object, the key of the S3 Object you want to download.                                   | If you want to download single file. Otherwise, it cannot be set.                   |
| file           | If downloading one single S3 object, the absolute path of the file where the object will be downloaded to.            | No. Can only be set if you are downloading a single file (i.e. if key is specified).|
| keyPrefix      | If downloading multiple S3 objects, this specifies the prefix the keys of the objects you're downloading should have. | If you want to download mutliple files. Otherwise, it cannot be set.                |
| dir            | If downloading multiple S3 objects, the target directory to download them to.                                         | Yes, if you are downloading multiple files (i.e. if "keyPrefix" is specified).      |


Some examples:


Downloading one file to a target file:
```
<download-from-s3 bucketName="mybucketname" key="mykey.txt" file="targetfile.txt" />
```

Result: Downloads object with key "mykey.txt" in bucket "mybucketname" to "targetfile.txt".
(Note that in Ant, any relative paths resolve based on the project's basedir)

Downloading one file without a target file:
```
 <download-from-s3 bucketName="mybucketname" key="mykey.txt" />
```
Result: Downloads object with key "mykey.txt" in bucket "mybucketname" to "mykey.txt"

Downloading several files:
```
 <download-from-s3 bucketName="mybucketname" keyPrefix="myprefix/" dir="~/targetdir/" /> 
```
Result: Downloads all objects whose keys begin with "myprefix/" to "~/targetdir/", with file names equal to their keys.

Nested elements:

Nested Settings. A setting is a wrapper for an [Option Value](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options.html), and similarly has three fields: namespace, optionName, and value

Example code: Simple web service:

```
<create-beanstalk-env applicationName="mybeanstalkapp" cnamePrefix="myprefix" environmentName="mybeanstalkenv" environmentDescription="myEnv" solutionStackName="64bit AmazonLinux running Tomcat 6">
     <Setting namespace="aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration" optionname="IAmInstanceProfile" value="ElasticBeanstalkProfile />
</create-beanstalk-env>
```

Nested elements:

Nested LayerIds. LayerIds only have one field, "value," used to specify the ID of a layer to associate this instance with. You can specify as many as you want, but you must specify at least one. Used as <LayerId value="..." />
If you create a Layer earlier in the build, and "useProjectLayerIds" is set to true, you don't have to specify layerIds because it will use the layers created earlier in the build.

Example code:

```
<create-opsworks-instance instanceType="m1.small" availabilityZone="us-east-1b" propertyNameForInstanceId="instanceId" stackId="${previously-specified-stack-id} >
    <LayerId value=${previously-defined-layer-id} />
</create-opsworks-instance>
```
Result: Creates an OpsWorks instance associated with the given layerId, and sets the "instanceId" property to the ID of the resulting instance.

Nested elements:

Nested AppAttributes. AppAttributes are simply key-value pairs to associate with an app. AppAttributes are used simply as <AppAttribute key="..." value="..." /> (Both fields are required)

Nested Domains. Domains only have on element, "value," which is used to specify a custom domain. Used as <Domain value="..." />

Nested DataSources. DataSources have three elements: "type," "arn," and "databaseName," used to specify the type of data source, the arn of the data source, and the name of a database to use. Used as <DataSource type="..." arn="..." databaseName="..." />

No nested elements are required.

Example code: 

```
<create-opsworks-app name="MyApp" type="java" repoType="s3" repoUrl="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mypublicbucket/mypublicjavaapp.war" stackId=${previously-defined-stack-id}/>
<echo message="New app (id=${appId}) is created." />
```

Creates an OpsWorks app called "MyApp" in OpsWorks, using a public app repository, then sets the "appId" property to the resulting app's ID.

Another example:

```
<create-opsworks-app name="MyApp" type="java" repoType="s3" repoUrl="https://s3.amazonaws.com/myprivatebucket/myprivatejavaapp.war" useAwsKeysForRepo="true" propertyNameForAppId="myAppId" stackId=${previously-defined-stack-id}/>
<echo message="New app (id=${myAppId}) is created." />
```

Creates an OpsWorks app called "myApp" in OpsWorks using the default credential chain to find credentials to access you private repository, then sets the "myAppId" property to the ID of the resulting app.

Nested elements:

Nested InstanceIds. InstanceIDs have one field, "value," used to specify the ID of an instance to deploy the app to. Used as <InstanceID value="..." />

Nested Commands. Commands have one element, "name," the name of the command, as well as any number of nested Args. Args themselves have one element, "name," the name of the arg, as well as any number of nested ArgVals. ArgVals have one field, "value," used to specify the argument value.
Commands are used as <Command name="..." /> or as

```
<Command name="...">
    <Arg name="...>
        <ArgVal value="..."/>
        <ArgVal value="..."/>
    </Arg>
</Command>
```
You must specify exactly one Command.

Example code: 

```
<deploy-opsworks-app propertyNameForDeploymentId="deploymentId1" comment="deploying v1 of MyApp" stackId="${previously-specified-stack-id" instanceId="${previously-specified-instance-id} >
    <Command name="deploy" />
    <InstanceId value="${previously-specified-instance-id}"/>
</deploy-opsworks-app>
```

Nested elements:

Nested Domains. Domains only have on element, "value," which is used to specify a custom domain. Used as <Domain value="..." />

No nested elements are required.

Example code:

```

Incremental Deployment Task
---------------------------

To use this task, you specify deployment groups, which have any number of nested <deploy-opsworks-app> elements. All <deploy-opsworks-app> tasks in the same <DeploymentGroup> will run in parallel, but the task will not proceed to the next deployment group until all deployments in the group succeed.
The only elements in this task are nexted DeploymentGroups (Used as <DeploymentGroup><!--deployments here--></DeploymentGroup>) which themselves have nested <deploy-opsworks-app> tasks.

Example code:

```
<incremental-opsworks-deployment>
    <DeploymentGroup>
        <deploy-opsworks-app propertyNameForDeploymentId="deploymentId1">
            <Command name="deploy" />
            <InstanceId value="${previously-defined-instanceId1}"/>
        </deploy-opsworks-app>
        <deploy-opsworks-app propertyNameForDeploymentId="deploymentId2">
            <Command name="deploy" />
            <InstanceId value="${previously-defined-instanceId2}"/>
        </deploy-opsworks-app>
    </DeploymentGroup>
    <DeploymentGroup>
        <deploy-opsworks-app propertyNameForDeploymentId="deploymentId3">
            <Command name="deploy" />
            <InstanceId value="${previously-defined-instanceId3}"/>
        </deploy-opsworks-app>
        <deploy-opsworks-app propertyNameForDeploymentId="deploymentId4">
            <Command name="deploy" />
            <InstanceId value="${previously-defined-instanceId4}"/>
        </deploy-opsworks-app>
    </DeploymentGroup>
    <DeploymentGroup>
        <deploy-opsworks-app propertyNameForDeploymentId="deploymentId5">
            <Command name="deploy" />
            <InstanceId value="${previously-defined-instanceId5}"/>
        </deploy-opsworks-app>
    </DeploymentGroup>
</incremental-opsworks-deployment>
```

Result: deploys deploymentId1 and deploymentId2, blocks until they finish, then deploys deploymentId3 and deployment Id4, blocks until they finish, finally deploys deploymentId5 and blocks until it finishes.

AWS CloudFormation Tasks Usage Guide
======================================

Create stack task
------------------

This task creates a stack in CloudFormation using either a URL you specify, or a (well-formed, escaped) string specified right in the body of the task call.

Parameters:

| Attribute        | Description                                                                 | Required?                                                                                                                                |

| onFailure        | An action to execute on failure.                                            | No. If this element is set, disableRollback should not be set. If disableRollback is set, this should not be set.                        |
| stackName        | What to name this stack.                                                    | Yes.                                                                                                                                     |
| stackPolicyBody  | Well formed, properly escaped JSON specifying a stack policy.               | No. If this is set, stackPolicyURL cannot be set. If stackPolicyURL is set, this cannot be set.                                          |
| stackPolicyUrl   | A valid URL pointing to a JSON object specifying a stack policy.            | No. If this is set, stackPolicyBody cannot be set. If stackPolicyBody is set, this cannot be set.                                        |
| templateBody     | Well formed, properly escaped JSON specifying a stack policy.               | If this is set, templateURL cannot be set. If templateURL is set, this cannot be set. It is required that this or templateURL be set.    |
| templateURL      | A valid URL pointing to a JSON object specifying a template.                | If this is set, templateBody cannot be set. If templateBody is set, this cannot be set. It is required that this or templateBody be set. |
| disableRollback  | Whether to disable rollback if stack creation fails.                        | No. Has a default of "false". If this is set, onFailure cannot be set.                                                                   |
| waitForCreation  | Whether to block the build until this stack successfully finishes creation. | No. Has a default of "false"                                                                                                             |
| timeoutInMinutes |  The amount of time to allow the stack to take to create before failing.    | Yes, must be greater than 0.                                                                                                             |

Nested elements:

Nested StackCapabilities. A StackCapability has only one element, "value," which is used to specify a capability you want to add to a stack. Used as <StackCapability value="..." />

Nested NotificationArns. A NotificationArn has only one element, "value," which is used to specify a NotificationArn you want to add to the stack. Used as <NotificationArn value="..." />

Nested StackParameters. A StackParameter is a key-value pair, where "key" is the name of the stack parameter to set, and "value" is the parameter's value. 
Instead of specifying "value," you can set "usePreviousValue" to "true", and the previous value will be used. Used as <StackParameter key="..." value="..." /> or <StackParameter key=".." usePreviousValue="true" />

Nested StackTags. StackTags are simply key value pairs to associate with the stack. Used as <StackTag key="..." value="..." />

No nested elements are required by the task, however the template you specified may require that you specify some StackParameters. 

Example code:

```
<create-cloudformation-stack stackName="anttaskteststack" timeoutInMinutes="100"
templateURL="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-west-2/WordPress_Multi_AZ.template">
    <StackParameter key="KeyName" value="myKeyName" />
</create-cloudformation-stack>
```

Result: Uses [this](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-west-2/WordPress_Multi_AZ.template) template to create "anttaskteststack", specifying that the build should fail if it takes more than 100 minutes. Uses "myKeyName" as the key pair for your EC2 instances.

Nested elements: 

Nested StackCapabilities. A StackCapability has only one element, "value," which is used to specify a capability you want to add to a stack. Used as <StackCapability value="..." />

Nested NotificationArns. A NotificationArn has only one element, "value," which is used to specify a NotificationArn you want to add to the stack. Used as <NotificationArn value="..." />

Nested StackParameters. A StackParameter is a key-value pair, where "key" is the name of the stack parameter to set, and "value" is the parameter's value. 
Instead of specifying "value," you can set "usePreviousValue" to "true", and the previous value will be used. Used as <StackParameter key="..." value="..." /> or <StackParameter key=".." usePreviousValue="true" />

No nested elements are required by the task, however the template you specified may require that you specify some StackParameters. 

Example code:

```
<update-cloudformation-stack stackName="anttaskteststack" usePreviousTemplate="true">
    <StackParameter key="KeyName" usePreviousValue="true" />
    <StackParameter key="WebServerCapacity" value="3" />
</update-cloudformation-stack>
```

Result: updates "anttaskteststack", using the same template as before and keeping the key name the same, but setting the web server capacity to 3.

Example code:

```
 <set-cloudformation-stack-policy stackName="anttaskteststack"
            stackPolicyBody="{
                   &quot;Statement&quot;: [{
                    &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Deny&quot;,
                    &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;Update:*&quot;,
                    &quot;Principal&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,
                    &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;LogicalResourceId/DBInstance&quot;
                }, {
                    &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
                    &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;Update:*&quot;,
                    &quot;Principal&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,

                }]
            }" />
```

Result: Updates "anttaskteststack" with the specified JSON object. This policy prevents any updates to the stack's DBInstance, but allows all other updates.

Wait For Stack To Reach State Task
----------------------------------

Blocks the build until the specified stack reaches the specified state. Fails the build if the state contains "FAILED".
